Making Changes to a Modularized Boost Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to make modifications to project boost.python, with the
intention of eventually making a merge request to the project's owner.

.. warning:: Do these steps in order!!!


.. I think this is an abuse of “rubric.”  Google “define:rubric” to
.. see what I mean.  These should be regular sections, or ordered
.. lists, or something.

.. rubric:: Clone the Boost superproject on Github


.. I cleaned up the below as best I could, but you need to get rid of
.. spurious clones on Gitorious before I really know what to do with
.. it.  Please do that and check the paragraph over to make sure it
.. makes sense.

Make a clone of boost on github, using the "Fork" link on
`ryppl's github page
<http://github.com/boost-lib/boost>`_.  Later this will contain a
modified submodule pointing to our clone of python, which we will
create later.  The other Boost library submodules will continue to
refer to their standard “official” locations.

.. rubric:: Clone the Boost.Python project on github

Using the same procedure as .above, clone the python project.  The
Fork button is on `this page <http://github.com/boost-lib/python>`_.

.. rubric:: Clone your Boost clone the local
   machine

.. I think this maybe should be the 2nd step.  That way, we're dealing
.. just with superproject clones and then we move on to the
.. subproject.

See :ref:`getting_started`, using the url of your clone on github.
.. That sentence should be made clearer, but it may be best just to
.. repeat the instructions here so the poor reader doesn't have to
.. bounce around with hyperlinks.
The following steps will take place inside the local clone.

.. rubric:: Remove the old submodule

.. The following steps look **waaaay** too complicated.  We need to
.. find a way to make “point the python submodule at your clone” one
.. reasonably digestible step.

Remove these lines from :file:`.gitmodules`::

  [submodule "src/python"]
          path = src/python
          url = git://github.com/boost-lib/python.git
  
Add :file:`.gitmodules` to the pending commit::

  git add .gitmodules

Remove these lines from :file:`.git/config`::

  [submodule "src/python"]
          url = git://github.com/boost-lib/python.git
  
This is just for cleanliness, not part of the commit.

Remove the submodule from the cache::

  % git rm --cached src/python 
  rm 'src/python'

Git now shows that we're ready to delete it::

  $ git status
  # On branch 1.41.0
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/1.41.0' by 1 commit.
  #
  # Changes to be committed:
  #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
  #
  #       modified:   .gitmodules
  #       deleted:    src/python
  #
  # Modified submodules:
  #
  # * src/python 028025b...0000000 (5):
  #   < add some version numbers
  #
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
  #
  #       src/python/
  
Commit the change::

  % git commit -m "changing python submodule..."
  [1.41.0 489023d] changing python submodule...
   1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
   delete mode 160000 src/python
  
Now you've removed the old submodule.

.. rubric:: add the new submodule

First remove the untracked directory corresponding to the submodule::

  % rm -r src/python

Now add the new one::

  % git submodule add git://github.com/boost-lib/your-python.git src/python
  Initialized empty Git repository in /home/you/Projects/ryppl/tmp/boost2/src/python/.git/

  Resolving deltas: 100% (468/468), done.

.. note:: Notice I have used the ``git://`` url, not the ``git@`` url.
   	  The ``git://`` url is readonly and is the only type of URL
   	  that should be committed to the superproject.  The ``git@``
   	  urls are readwrite and authenticated via SSH.  I will soon
   	  use the latter to push commits from submodules, but I never
   	  commit them to superprojects.

Now that the python repository now points to the right place::

  $ grep url src/python/.git/config 
          url = git://github.com/boost-lib/your-python.git

Now git tells us that we've added the submodule, and shows the new
head commit::

  % git status
  # On branch 1.41.0
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/1.41.0' by 2 commits.
  #
  # Changes to be committed:
  #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

  #       new file:   src/python

  # Modified submodules:
  #
  # * src/python 0000000...8d3d698 (21):
  #   > that's basically it for overload resolution some upcoming numpy stuff mixed in :/
  #
  
And ``git diff --cached tells me``::

  diff --git a/.gitmodules b/.gitmodules
  index 30ccec5..64e4e98 100644

Wherein you can see that the new submodule has been added to
:file:`.gitmodules` and the exact commit of the submodule is somehow
associated (``file mode 160000``) with the path :file:`src/python`.

Commit the change::

  % git commit -m "add my python branch"
  [1.41.0 64d5917] add my python branch
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

Now you can push your changes to your ryppl branch.

Make and push modifications to your python project
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Cd to project, modify a file, add to commit and commit::

  $ cd src/python
  $ echo "// modifications to python" >> include/boost/python.hpp 
  $ git add include/boost/python.hpp
  $ git commit -m "Dummy commit... demonstrating ryppl"

*Always* push your modifications to submodules before you commit the
modifications to the ryppl branch.  If you try to just push, git
complains::

  $ git push
  fatal: protocol error: expected sha/ref, got '
  ----------------------------------------------
  The git:// protocol is read-only.
  
  Please use the push url as listed on the repository page.
  ----------------------------------------------'
  
So add a remote that is writable.  I use the 'push' (``git@``) url and
name it *readwrite*::

  $ git remote add readwrite git@github.com:boost-lib/your-python.git

And push::

  $ git push readwrite

  Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.

  => Syncing github... [OK]
  To git@github.com:boost-lib/your-python.git
     8d3d698..d6e0e56  HEAD -> master

Now check your status up in the ryppl directory::

  $ git status
  # On branch 1.41.0
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/1.41.0' by 3 commits.
  #
  # Changed but not updated:
  #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
  #
  #       modified:   src/python
  #
  
You can just commit this, but let's check some stuff first.  ``git submodule status`` shows ::

  $ git submodule status
   6dce83c277d48644fac187799876799eb66c97a2 cmake (heads/master)
   0628a7a2d999bbbd62fd9877922c057f5f056114 src/accumulators (remotes/origin/1.41.0)
   5cec8044c5408fadee71110194027b0e99b44721 src/algorithm (remotes/origin/1.41.0)
   ...
   49b781309f926ea9a2bed09091fe276f32f7a92a src/core (remotes/origin/1.41.0)
  +8d3d698c598e1779f932e8a29e9131a23d55388e src/python  <-- plus
  
The plus means that the head of the currently checked out submodule
doesn't match what is in the index, and ``submodule summary`` shows::

    $ git submodule summary
  * src/python 8d3d698...d6e0e56 (1):
    > Dummy commit... demonstrating ryppl

specifically what the new commits are.  Now you'd commit and push the
modifications to the superproject::

  $ git add src/python/
  $ git commit -m "update python"
  [1.41.0 709256c] update python
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
  % git push
  Counting objects: 18, done.
  Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
  Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
  Writing objects: 100% (15/15), 1.19 KiB, done.
  Total 15 (delta 11), reused 0 (delta 0)
   
Now, you send email with your ryppl repository... when others check it
out and then ``submodule init`` and ``submodule update`` they get your
modifications to the python project.
