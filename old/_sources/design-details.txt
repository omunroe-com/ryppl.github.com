Design Details
::::::::::::::

Notes that didn't fit elsewhere about how things should be organized.

- Incremental testing is absolutely required.
- Releasability tests combine testing results with expected failure markup.
- Expected failure markup is stored per-library.
- Notifications initially via email
- Maintainer stored per project
